"""Monkeypatch verl's NUMA-affinity pinning to work on Intel XPU, with zero
verl-core changes.

The gap being closed: `verl/utils/distributed.py::set_numa_affinity()` pins
each worker to the CPU cores local to its GPU via
`pynvml.nvmlDeviceSetCpuAffinity()`. On XPU `pynvml` isn't installed, so the
call raises `ImportError` -- which that function already catches. It prints a
warning and returns. Nothing crashes, nothing fails a test; every XPU
training run so far simply ran un-pinned, paying cross-socket memory traffic
between each worker and its own GPU for the life of the job. A silent
performance tax, not a correctness bug.

There is no CPU-affinity equivalent anywhere in `torch.xpu` or `pyzes`
(pyzes covers only telemetry: temperature/power/clock/utilization/memory).
This patch builds one from the same primitives NVML uses internally on
Linux:

    zesDevicePciGetProperties -> PCI BDF
      -> /sys/bus/pci/devices/<bdf>/numa_node
      -> /sys/devices/system/node/nodeN/cpulist
      -> os.sched_setaffinity

Keyed per device index, not per pod: a single pod's two GPUs can sit on two
different NUMA nodes (observed on a 2x B60 pod: device 0 on node 0,
device 1 on node 1), so pinning "the pod" to one NUMA node would be wrong.

Dispatch shape, and why this patch is applied where it is
--------------------------------------------------------
Unlike `attention_patch_xpu`, there is no per-call dispatch object to
intercept here. `set_numa_affinity` is a plain module-level function, and
both call sites bind it *by value* at their own import time:

    verl/workers/engine_workers.py:39
        from verl.utils.distributed import initialize_global_process_group_ray, set_numa_affinity
    verl/model_merger/megatron_model_merger.py:44
        from verl.utils.distributed import set_numa_affinity

So reassigning `verl.utils.distributed.set_numa_affinity` only takes effect
for a given call site if it happens before that call site's own
`set_numa_affinity()` runs -- either because the patch landed before the
call site imported the name, or because `_rebind_importers()` below fixes
up an already-imported module's binding before it's used.

`apply()` is called from `PlatformXPU.__init__`, same convention as
`reduce_avg_allreduce_patch_xpu` -- only once verl has actually selected XPU
for this process, so a host where a different platform is selected (e.g.
`VERL_PLATFORM=nvidia` on a mixed box) never has this function touched at
all. In practice `PlatformXPU` is usually constructed while verl's engine
modules are still being imported (e.g. `verl/workers/engine/fsdp/
transformer_impl.py` calls `get_device_name()` at module scope), so the patch
typically lands before `engine_workers` binds the name. That ordering is an
implementation detail of verl-core's imports, not a contract, so
`_rebind_importers()` covers the case where `engine_workers` is imported
first.

**Known gap: the checkpoint-merge path is not covered.**
`MegatronModelMerger.__init__` calls `set_numa_affinity()` on line 154 and
`get_nccl_backend()` -- the first thing on that path to call
`get_platform()`, and therefore the first thing to construct `PlatformXPU`
-- only on line 155, one line later. By the time this patch would be
applied, that call has already run against the original, un-pinned
function. No apply site can fix this without changing verl-core: the
platform genuinely is not selected yet when the call happens. Checkpoint
merging is a short, one-shot CPU-bound utility, not a sustained training
loop, so the cost of staying un-pinned there is far smaller than on the
training path this patch does cover. (The training path itself is fine:
`initialize_global_process_group_ray()` on line 90 of `engine_workers.py`
goes through `get_device_name()`/`get_nccl_backend()`, constructing
`PlatformXPU` and running this patch, before line 92's call.)

Because `apply()` runs only once XPU is confirmed selected, the platform
check inside the patched function (`_platform_is_xpu()`) is redundant in the
common case -- but kept anyway as a cheap guard against the platform
singleton being reassigned later via `set_platform()`, and because
`PlatformXPU()` can be constructed and then discarded during auto-detection
probing on a non-XPU host (see `platform_manager._detect_platform_name()`);
in that case `apply()` still runs, but the wrapped function's own check
means it is a no-op for as long as some other platform stays selected.
